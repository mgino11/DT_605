 Problem 2

(Binomial). The probability of your organization receiving a Joint Commission inspection in any given month is .05. What is the probability that, after 24 months, you received exactly 2 inspections? What is the probability that, after 24 months, you received 2 or more inspections? What is the probability that your received fewer than 2 inspections? What is the expected number of inspections you should have received? What is the standard deviation?

### Solution

$$
(Px) = {n \choose x} \times p^2 \times (1-p)^{n-x}
$$
X = 2, p = .05, n = 24

$$
(Px=2) = {24 \choose 2} \times .05^2 \times (.95)^{22}
$$

```{r}
#two_insp <- choose(24, 2) * .05^2 * .95^22

1 - pbinom(1,24,.05)

```

Exactly two inspections `r two_insp` (or `r two_insp * 100`%).

```{r}
# For exactly 2
dbinom(2, size=24, prob=0.05) 
```

Confirming above with an R function

```{r}
less_than_two <- pbinom(1, size=24, prob=0.05) 
two_or_more <- 1 - less_than_two
```

Two or more inspections `r two_or_more` (or `r two_or_more * 100`%) and less than two inspections `r less_than_two` (or `r less_than_two * 100`%).

```{r}
n <- 24
prob <- .05
x <- 0:24
p <- dbinom(x,n,prob)
(p * 100)
```

The result with the highest probability (or likelihood) is 1.

```{r}
# Compute mean
mu <- sum(x*p)
# Compute variance
sigma.sq=sum(x^2*p)-mu^2
# Compute standarad deviation
sigma=sqrt(sigma.sq)
```

Mean (or expected value) is `r mu`.

Variance is `r sigma.sq`.

Standard deviation is `r sigma`.

# Problem 4

(Hypergeometric). Your subordinate with 30 supervisors was recently accused of favoring nurses. 15 of the subordinateâ€™s workers are nurses and 15 are other than nurses. As evidence of malfeasance, the accuser stated that there were 6 company-paid trips to Disney World for which everyone was eligible. The supervisor sent 5 nurses and 1 non-nurse. If your subordinate acted innocently, what was the probability he/she would have selected five nurses for the trips? How many nurses would we have expected your subordinate to send? How many non-nurses would we have expected your subordinate to send?

30 supervisors
15 nurses 
15 other

### Solution

$$
P(X=k) = \frac{{K \choose k} \times {N-K \choose n-k}}{{N \choose n}}
$$

Where: 

- K is the number of successes in the population

- k is the number of observed successes

- N is the population size

- n is the number of draws

#### Probability of 5 nurses

```{r}
K <- 15
k <- 5
N <- 30
n <- 6
result <- choose(K, k) * choose(N-K, n-k) / choose(N,n)
result
```

Probability of 5 nurses selected is: `r result` (or `r result * 100`%).

#### Expected count of nurses

```{r}
# Specify x-values for dhyper function 
x_dhyper <- seq(0, 6, by = 1) 
# Apply dhyper function 
y_dhyper <- dhyper(x_dhyper, m = 15, n = 15, k = 6) 
y_dhyper
```

Using the $dhyper$ function, the most likely outcome is 3 nurses with a probability of 34.8659%. And given that 3 nurses is the most likely outcome, then 3 non-nurses is the expected result for non-nurses. Given the symmetry of the question, 30 individuals of that 15 nurses, and 15 non-nurses, the expected result is 3 of each.



# Problem 6

You are working in a hospital that is running off of a primary generator which fails about once in 1000 hours. What is the probability that the generator will fail more than twice in 1000 hours? What is the expected value?

### Solution

#### Failure more than twice

```{r}
more_than_two <- 1 - pbinom(2, size=1000, prob=0.001) 
```

Probability the generator will fail more than twice in 1000 hours: `r more_than_two` or (`r more_than_two * 100`%).

#### Expected value

```{r}
n <- 1000
prob <- .001
# Compute mean
mu <- n*prob
```

The mean, or expected value, for the given scenario is: `r mu`.
