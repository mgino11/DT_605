## 5.1 - 6

Let X1, X2, . . . , Xn be n mutually independent random variables, each of which is uniformly distributed on the integers from 1 to k. Let Y denote the minimum of the Xi’s. Find the distribution of Y .

Y = min(X1, X2,…Xn)

sample:

```{r}
k = 10

sample(k)
```

```{r}
sample <- runif(k, min = 1, max = k)
summary(sample)
```

```{r}
sample_dist <- punif(k, min = 1, max = k)

sample_dist
```

```{r}
plot(sample, type = "h")
```
```{r}
y <- min(sample)

y_dist <- punif(y, min = 1, max = k)

plot(y, type = "h")
```
